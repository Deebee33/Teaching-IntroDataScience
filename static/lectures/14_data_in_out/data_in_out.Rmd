# Data input

We can get data into R through keyboard, from the clipboard, or from an external file (local or online).

We have learned the `c()` function to concatenate data as a vector.

We can also use the `scan()` function if we want to type or paste a few numbers into a vector from the keyboard.

**Demo**

You can also use scan to paste in groups of numbers from the clipboard. In Excel, highlight the column of numbers you want, then type `Ctrl+C`. Now go back into R. At the 1: prompt just type `Ctrl+V` and the numbers will be scanned into R.

**Demo**
